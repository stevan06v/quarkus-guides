# 🧠 What Does "Reactively" Mean in This Context?

In **Quarkus + Mutiny**, **reactivity** means that your application:
1. **Does not block threads** while waiting for operations (e.g., database queries, API calls).
2. **Efficiently handles asynchronous operations** (e.g., fetching todos, processing data, sending responses).
3. **Uses non-blocking streams (`Uni`, `Multi`)** to process data **only when it's available**.

---

## 🚀 Reactive vs. Traditional (Blocking) Approach
Let's compare **reactive vs. traditional approaches** when fetching todos and generating a report.

---

## 🛑 1️⃣ Blocking Approach (Traditional, Not Reactive)

In a traditional Java application (e.g., using JPA, Spring Boot), you **wait for** the database query to complete **before** doing anything else.

```java
public TodoReport getTodoReport() {
    List<Todo> todos = fetchTodos();  // ❌ Blocks until DB returns results
    
    long todoCount = todos.size();
    long completedCount = todos.stream().filter(Todo::isCompleted).count();
    long uncompletedCount = todoCount - completedCount;

    return new TodoReport(todoCount, completedCount, uncompletedCount);
}
```

### 📌 **Problem:**
- The **fetchTodos() call blocks** the thread **until** the database query finishes.
- **If the database is slow**, your entire app **waits** (bad performance).
- In **high-traffic systems**, **many requests can block threads**, leading to slow responses.

---

## ✅ 2️⃣ Reactive Approach (Using Mutiny's `Uni`)

Instead of blocking, **we let the computation happen asynchronously** and react to the result when it's ready.

```java
import io.smallrye.mutiny.Uni;
import java.util.List;

public Uni<TodoReport> getTodoReport() {
    return fetchTodos()
        .onItem()
        .transform(todos -> {
            long todoCount = todos.size();
            long completedCount = todos.stream().filter(Todo::isCompleted).count();
            long uncompletedCount = todoCount - completedCount;

            return new TodoReport(todoCount, completedCount, uncompletedCount);
        });
}
```

### 📌 **Why is this reactive?**
- **`fetchTodos()` does not block** the thread; it immediately returns a `Uni<List<Todo>>`.
- **When the data arrives**, `.onItem().transform()` processes it.
- **The computation happens asynchronously**, so the app can handle other requests **without waiting**.

---

## 🚀 Why You Still "Wait" in a Reactive API
You're absolutely right—whether **blocking or reactive**, you always need to **wait** for data before sending a response. The difference is **how** you wait.

- **Blocking (Traditional)** → **Thread waits** until data is available.
- **Reactive (Non-blocking)** → **Thread is freed**, and the response is sent once data arrives.

With a **blocking API**, the **server thread is occupied** while waiting for the database.  
With a **reactive API**, the **server thread is free** to handle other requests while waiting for the database.

### **🚀 What Happens in Your API Call (`getReport`)?**
When a client calls **`GET /report`**, the server must:
1. **Fetch todos from the database** (this takes time).
2. **Process the todos** (calculate counts).
3. **Return the `TodoReport`** to the client.

This happens **whether blocking or reactive**—the difference is **how efficiently** the waiting is handled.

### **🚀 Key Difference: Who Handles the Waiting?**
| Approach | How It Waits? | Impact on Performance |
|----------|--------------|----------------------|
| **Blocking** | Server **thread waits** | **Inefficient for high traffic** |
| **Reactive** | **A worker thread waits, main thread is free** | **More efficient, scales better** |

---

## 🚀 Why Reactivity is More Efficient
1. **Worker Threads vs. Main Threads**  
   - In a **blocking** system, each request **locks a main thread** while waiting.
   - In a **reactive** system, the request is **delegated** to an I/O worker, freeing the main thread for other requests.

2. **Thread Pool Utilization**  
   - A blocking system needs **many more threads** to handle concurrent requests.
   - A reactive system uses **fewer worker threads**, making it **more scalable**.

3. **Event-Driven Execution**  
   - In reactivity, a **callback/event triggers execution** only when data arrives.
   - This avoids **constant polling** or unnecessary resource usage.

---

## 🚀 Real-World Example: Why Reactivity Matters

Imagine **1000 users request the report** at the same time.

| Approach  | What Happens?  | Performance Impact  |
|-----------|--------------|----------------|
| **Blocking (Traditional)** | Each request **waits** for the DB | **Threads get stuck**, app slows down |
| **Reactive (Non-blocking)** | Each request **processes data asynchronously** | **App remains responsive**, handles more requests |

### 🔹 With reactivity, your app can:
✔ Handle **many concurrent requests**.  
✔ Free up system resources while waiting for **database, APIs, or IO**.  
✔ Scale **efficiently** without blocking threads.

---

## 🎯 Final Summary
- **Blocking:** Waits for DB results **before moving forward** (slower, bad for scalability).
- **Reactive:** **Does not wait** → Reacts when data is ready (efficient, scales better).
- **Use `Uni` & `.onItem().transform()`** to process data **only when it becomes available**.
