# 🧠 What Does "Reactively" Mean in This Context?

In **Quarkus + Mutiny**, **reactivity** means that your application:
1. **Does not block threads** while waiting for operations (e.g., database queries, API calls).
2. **Efficiently handles asynchronous operations** (e.g., fetching todos, processing data, sending responses).
3. **Uses non-blocking streams (`Uni`, `Multi`)** to process data **only when it's available**.

---

## 🚀 Reactive vs. Traditional (Blocking) Approach
Let's compare **reactive vs. traditional approaches** when fetching todos and generating a report.

---

## 🛑 1️⃣ Blocking Approach (Traditional, Not Reactive)

In a traditional Java application (e.g., using JPA, Spring Boot), you **wait for** the database query to complete **before** doing anything else.

```java
public TodoReport getTodoReport() {
    List<Todo> todos = fetchTodos();  // ❌ Blocks until DB returns results
    
    long todoCount = todos.size();
    long completedCount = todos.stream().filter(Todo::isCompleted).count();
    long uncompletedCount = todoCount - completedCount;

    return new TodoReport(todoCount, completedCount, uncompletedCount);
}
```

### 📌 **Problem:**
- The **fetchTodos() call blocks** the thread **until** the database query finishes.
- **If the database is slow**, your entire app **waits** (bad performance).
- In **high-traffic systems**, **many requests can block threads**, leading to slow responses.

---

## ✅ 2️⃣ Reactive Approach (Using Mutiny's `Uni`)

Instead of blocking, **we let the computation happen asynchronously** and react to the result when it's ready.

```java
import io.smallrye.mutiny.Uni;
import java.util.List;

public Uni<TodoReport> getTodoReport() {
    return fetchTodos()
        .onItem()
        .transform(todos -> {
            long todoCount = todos.size();
            long completedCount = todos.stream().filter(Todo::isCompleted).count();
            long uncompletedCount = todoCount - completedCount;

            return new TodoReport(todoCount, completedCount, uncompletedCount);
        });
}
```

### 📌 **Why is this reactive?**
- **`fetchTodos()` does not block** the thread; it immediately returns a `Uni<List<Todo>>`.
- **When the data arrives**, `.onItem().transform()` processes it.
- **The computation happens asynchronously**, so the app can handle other requests **without waiting**.

## 🚀 Real-World Example: Why Reactivity Matters

Imagine **1000 users request the report** at the same time.

| Approach  | What Happens?  | Performance Impact  |
|-----------|--------------|----------------|
| **Blocking (Traditional)** | Each request **waits** for the DB | **Threads get stuck**, app slows down |
| **Reactive (Non-blocking)** | Each request **processes data asynchronously** | **App remains responsive**, handles more requests |

### 🔹 With reactivity, your app can:
✔ Handle **many concurrent requests**.  
✔ Free up system resources while waiting for **database, APIs, or IO**.  
✔ Scale **efficiently** without blocking threads.

---

## 🎯 Final Summary
- **Blocking:** Waits for DB results **before moving forward** (slower, bad for scalability).
- **Reactive:** **Does not wait** → Reacts when data is ready (efficient, scales better).
- **Use `Uni` & `.onItem().transform()`** to process data **only when it becomes available**.
